# Lean Coffee

The goal is to build a [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) app that we can use as a group to
suggest and vote on popular topics for discussion prior to our scheduled meetups. This allows us
to brainstorm more interesting topics and organize who will be in each discussion and at what time
they will happen.

## Overview

The app is composed of a [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) backend, a [React](https://reactjs.org/)
frontend initialized by the [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) tool,
and a Postgres database.

Other components: Redux, GraphQL, Typescript, Material UI

## Requirements

- Make
- Docker & Docker Compose

## Development

- Run `make dev` at the root of this project.
- Visit the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- Make your code changes! The app should be live-reloaded whenever you save.
